# am-research
Repository for research in [prediciting material performance of additively manufactured materials](https://studentresearch.engineering.columbia.edu/content/data-science-and-predicting-material-performance-additive-manufacturing-carleton-lab).

## objectives
- build a standard for AM processing parameters and material features to generate consistent, high performing parts
  - different materials, printers, and parameters yield varying resulting performance
  - raw material feedstock + processing parameters -> ideal melt pool and density
  - apply DRL techniques to optimize scan path and 
- build ml models using processed data
- create infrastructure that makes training and testing with new data easy
- explore patterns and analyze insights, generate final report
