# am-research

Repository for research in [prediciting material performance of additively manufactured materials](https://studentresearch.engineering.columbia.edu/content/data-science-and-predicting-material-performance-additive-manufacturing-carleton-lab).

## current objectives

-- compile list of types of printers used by researchers

-- figure out the output conventions of these printers

-- reach out to research authors to retrieve their data if it's not easily found

-- if the data is muddled (as it always is), match the printer and conventions to the data to figure out what we're working with


## short-term goals

-- find a decent pool of data to start working with

-- process the data using the conventions above

-- using the features and labels Manion found in his report, starting building an analytical framework

## long-term goals

-- build a standard for AM processing parameters and material features to generate consistent, high performing parts
    
    -- different materials, printers, and parameters yield varying resulting performance
    
    -- raw material feedstock + processing parameters -> ideal melt pool and density
    
    -- apply DRL techniques to optimize scan path and 

-- build ml models using processed data

-- create infrastructure that makes training and testing with new data easy

-- explore patterns and analyze insights, generate final report
