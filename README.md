# am-research

Repository for research in [prediciting material performance of additively manufactured materials](https://studentresearch.engineering.columbia.edu/content/data-science-and-predicting-material-performance-additive-manufacturing-carleton-lab).

## current objectives

-- find substantial data, so far NIST is seeming the best option due to paywalls elsewhere (FEM to generate data?)

-- outreach to labs, professors, researchers, AM organizations

-- if the data is muddled (as it always is), match the printer and conventions to the data to figure out what we're working with

-- set up framework to deploy models
    - are we going to actually use these models or is this supposed to be theoretical? How much effort should I put into making it an actual web app vs focusing on lit review and developing a theoretical framework

## long-term goals

-- build a standard for AM processing parameters and material features to generate consistent, high performing parts
    
    -- different materials, printers, and parameters yield varying resulting performance
    
    -- raw material feedstock + processing parameters -> ideal melt pool and density
    
    -- apply DRL techniques to optimize scan path and 

-- build ml models using processed data

-- create infrastructure that makes training and testing with new data easy

-- explore patterns and analyze insights, generate final report
